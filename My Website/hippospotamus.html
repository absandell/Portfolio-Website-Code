                <h2>Hippo-Spotamus: The Spotify Playlist Generator</h2>
                <h4>Python | Spotify | Min-Heap | Weighted Graph | Spotify API</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Hippo-Spotamus, a Spotify Playlist generator that uses that Spotify data of ~170,000 songs to generate a uniquely catered list to a given song input. Developed in collaboration with Greg Garrett and Liam Stokes as the final project for COP3530 - Data Structures and Algorithms.
                <br>
                <br>
                I was responsible for generating a playlist using a Min-Heap data structure to classify and sort songs according to their weighted score that was designated by our algorithm. I was also in charge of translating and cleaning our CSV file to provide usable, easily accessed information within the program so that we could easily generate similar playlists. This included constructing the object framework that would serve as the base for the project, along with parsing input from the user.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our group is continuing to work on the project over the coming months, eventually fully integrating the Spotify API into our code, along with a working GUI that will allow the user to access and add their generated Spotify playlists directly from our program to their account.
